# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI
I designed a comprehensive HR dashboard using Power BI to analyze employee data across multiple dimensionsâ€”gender, job role, performance, and tenure. The dashboard visualizes key metrics like promotion eligibility, retrenchment status, job satisfaction, and service years for 1,470 employees.

Using DAX and data modeling, I created dynamic measures and relationships that reveal actionable insights for HR decision-making. The project showcases my ability to turn raw data into meaningful stories through interactive visuals and clean design.

  Tools: Power BI, DAX, Data Modeling
